            <h2 class="main2">12 Rules for Life by Jordan Peterson</h2>
            <p class="content2">Peterson’s book is written in a strikingly relaxed idiom and designed to provide self-help to those who have lost their way in today’s cross-currents, are suffering mental health issues or are hesitating at a traffic-laden crossroads in life. It is also fascinating and provoking for those who do not fit those categories. Students who are under stress could usefully read some chapters of this book, as should anyone thinking of starting a family. Anyone responsible for the care of young children would benefit from considering some of the pitfalls to avoid and behaviours to pursue. But no one should think that the rules Peterson lays down are of easy accomplishment; Norman Doidge in his Foreword acknowledges this. Peterson steadfastly refuses to be fitted into any particular religious or philosophical grouping. Yet he is one of those rare writers who is prepared to demonstrate unashamedly that religion – more specifically the Christian tradition – actually works: intellectually, psychologically, practically. But what Peterson precisely does not do is write any sort of apologia or seek to defend the historical veracity of the faith. That is not at all his purpose, and those hoping for that will be disappointed. But anyone open to considering different worldviews of a metaphysical kind would be engaged by the overall direction of Peterson’s arguments.</p>
