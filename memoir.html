            <h2 class="main2">Spare by Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex</h2>
            <p class="content2">For all the condemnation Harry has received for supposedly airing his family’s dirty linen to a global stage, what SPARE manages to achieve extremely well is the unwrapping and subsequent revealing of the heart that lies behind this ‘human zoo’, namely the royal family. SPARE humanises a family confined to a gilded cage, seemingly content with performing like trained monkeys while the paying public throw 24kt gold bananas into the cage for the privilege of dictating which trick we would like to be entertained with. And with the press as our acting mouth-piece as to whether the tricks live up to our ever changing expectations. If your purpose for reading SPARE is to become more entrenched in either “team Harry”, “team William”, “team or anti monarchy”, you actually do this book an injustice; simply because, the mirror that is being held up here is more than just shining a reflective light on Harry/the family/the firm, but one that includes shining a light upon us, society as a whole. Aside from this small criticism, SPARE is an enlightening read.  And I’m sure, after the dust has settled, there will be a general consensus that it was a much needed addition to royal family’s narrative.</p>
