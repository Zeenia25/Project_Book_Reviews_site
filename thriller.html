            <h2 class="main2">Insomnia by Sarah Pinborough</h2>
            <p class="content">Is there anything better than a psychological thriller that genuinely immerses the reader in its protagonist’s mindset—particularly when that protagonist is coming unglued? My favorite psychological thrillers deliver exactly that kind of paranoia-inducing, keep-you-on-your-toes reading experience; it’s no surprise, then, that I loved Sarah Pinborough’s INSOMNIA, which must be the most effectively-unsettling suspense novel I’ve read in ages. One of the greatest pleasures of this book (if I can call it that!) is the way this story keeps its readers off-kilter and on edge; as protagonist Emma begins to fear her own mind, readers will find themselves experiencing Emma’s fear right alongside her. INSOMNIA is a thriller you experience as much as you read it, and Pinborough brings Emma’s roiling emotions and increasing suspicion of everyone around her vividly to life. It’s a heady, hypnotic, seriously sinister reading experience, and a testament to the author’s writing that she is able to so effectively immerse readers in the unraveling of Emma’s sanity. In case you need further proof of just what a visceral reading experience this is: I read an early review of INSOMNIA that called it too unsettling. There’s no such thing as “too” unsettling in my book, and I consider it one of this book’s greatest selling points and strengths—and a testament to Pinborough’s immersive and effective writing—that anyone might describe it that way. Readers looking for a tense, edge-of-your-seat, seriously dark psychological thriller will find INSOMNIA to be just the book they needed. </p>
