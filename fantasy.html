            <p class="content2">The final book in The Mortal Instruments series, definitely a great read. Filled with romance, death, sorrow, action, suspense and much more, this book has a bit of everything. With some great twists this is a great conclusion to the series. A new group of characters were introduced in the beginning of the book which was a surprise. Turning Shadowhunters evil added an extra layer of adversity and potential emotional upset. The Blackthorns' father was one such unlucky soul to have been Turned. The question that is a large part of the novel is can they been turned back? This mystery, as well as a few other side mysteries that arise, give the story a sense of having multi-layers and perspectives.</p>
